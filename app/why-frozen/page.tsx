      "If you can go and buy a fish straight off the docks or catch it yourself we love you for that, other than that, Frozen is simply better. We believe that freezing fish soon after it is caught gives you a better experience than eating 'fresh' fish which may be kept chilled for a week or longer before it reaches your plate. Committing to frozen also means we can offer you the widest range of fish, of the highest quality, at all times. We believe that OUR frozen fish will give you the same eating experience as buying fish at the quayside and eating it straight away.",

    content:
      "Quality is determined by when, where and how the fish is caught, and how it is looked after between catching and delivery to your door. These days, quality is determined by when, where and how the fish is caught, and how it is looked after between catching and delivery to your door. A good fresh fish display looks wonderful, but it takes its toll on the fish. Exposure to the air degrades fish. Everyone knows how tired the display can look at the end of the day. Some of the best fish is caught by specialised vessels which freeze their catch on board within hours. Our hook and line caught Tuna is are flash frozen to -60Âºc after being caught, this demands a much higher price compared to tuna landed and processed ashore. This is because it is are superior.",

            WHY IS FRESH FISH OFTEN CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO FROZEN?

          <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
            <p>
              It`&apos;`s not because the fish was frozen. It was because the
              fish was inferior when frozen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until approximately 40 years ago, most fish in South Africa were
              caught by large trawlers which would undertake three week voyages
              to fishing grounds. Coastal waters were fished by smaller vessels
              which were back in port within a few days. These always had the
              best fish, because the fresher the fish at the point of landing,
              the better the quality, but today the majority of this catch
              struggles to reach the average person in and around the city
              quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              When commercial freezing was introduced, it was applied to the
              cheaper fish from the longer voyages. Frozen soon began to mean
              inferior. This reputation was largely justified, and it stuck. But
              it was not because the fish was frozen. It was because it was
              inferior when frozen.
